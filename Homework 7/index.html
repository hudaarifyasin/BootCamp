<h2 class="h2-first">Part One: The Basics of Web Development</h2>

<img class="image2" src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/6329443406577664/image/download/5951647323783168" alt="image2">

<h3 class="h3-1">What skills do you need as a web developer?</h3>

<p>Anyone can become a web developer. You don’t need a fancy degree in computer science to master the skills, but before you can start looking for jobs in the field, there are a few things you will need to learn.</p>
<ol class="ol-1">
   <li>The basics of how the Internet and websites work</li>
   <li>The basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
   <li>Libraries and frameworks, like jQuery, <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/what-is-react-tutorial" target="_blank"> React.js</a>, and  <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/react-bootstrap-tutorial" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a></li>
   <li>Other programming languages, like  <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/web-development-in-python" target="_blank">Python</a> and Ruby (for back-end web devs only)</li>
   <li> <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/git-github-tutorial-beginners" target="_blank">Git and GitHub</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
   Don’t let this overwhelm you. All of these skills naturally build off of each other, so it’s important to learn slowly and take it step-by-step as you develop a solid foundation.</p>

   <p>Alright, now you know what’s ahead of you. Let’s start learning!</p>

   <h3 class="h3-2">The Foundational Stuff</h3>
   <p>The Internet is comprised of three, interacting features.</p>

   <ul class="ul3">
      <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/behind-the-screens-what-happens-when-you-type-a-url-in-a-browser" target="_blank"> Websites</a>: a collection of files and information that we access through a computer and a server</li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/computer-networking-101" target="_blank"> Servers</a>: the computers that store all the data of websites in a massive network</li>
      <li> <strong> Browsers:</strong> the programs that load and display content on your computer</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Every website is comprised of the <strong> frontend </strong>(client side) and the <strong>backend</strong> (server side). The frontend includes everything that the user will directly see and experience when they visit a website. The backend is the behind the scenes where information is stored, sent, and received.</p>

  <p> Everything you see on a website, like the one you’re looking at now, is made up of HTML, CSS, and Javascript files.</p>

  <p>These are the most foundational tools that you need as a web developer. They are the languages you use to actually create your webpages.</p>

   <p>So, let’s learn what they do!</p>

   <div>
      <img class="image3" src="./download.png" alt="image3">
   </div>

   <h3 class="h3-3">What is HTML?</h3>
   <p><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/html-beginners-tutorial-build-from-scratch" target="_blank"> HTML</a> (HyperText Markup Language) is the basic programming language for web development. It provides the basic structure of a site such as words, titles, and paragraphs.</p>

     <p> HTML consists of a bunch of established <code class="code1"> tags</code>, which represent different functions that then “translate” into readable information on the screen. These tags are written between angle brackets.</p>
   
     <blockquote class="blockquote1">For example, the text surrounded by the <code class="code2">< b> < /b></code> 
      will be bold. The tag <code class="code3"> < h6> < /h6></code> 
       will make your text the smallest header size.</blockquote>

       <h3 class="h3-4">What is CSS?</h3>
    
       <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet that essentially describes how HTML elements will appear on a webpage. You use CSS to control the presentation, style, and formatting of your site, like <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/css-color-guide" target="_blank"> RGB values</a>, border colors, background images, and more.</p>

       <p>CSS files declare a set of rules, that define a set of properties and their values.</p>

      <p>For example:</p>

      <code class="code4">
         <span class="span1">< h4 style=</span>
         <span class="span2">"color:Tomato;"</span>
         <span class="span3"> > </span>
         <span class="span4">Tomato Red </span>
         <span class="span5"> < /h4></span>
      </code>
      
      <p>determines that the text “Tomato Red” should look like this:</p>

      <h4 class="h4-1">Tomato Red</h4>

      <h3 class="h3-5">What is JavaScript?</h3>

      <p>JavaScript is how you control the behavior of your webpage. If you’re serious about web development, you’ll need to start to <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/15-javascript-courses-learn-web-dev-html-and-css" target="_blank"> learn the basics of JavaScript</a>. It is one of the most popular and pervasive programming languages in the world, with a low entry barrier and offers immediate results based on the success of your code.</p>

      <p>JavaScript makes websites interactive by manipulating your various HTML and CSS features. With JavaScript, a user can click on a button, scroll to the bottom of a page, or display photos in a moving carousel.</p>

      <p>For example, this chunk of code dictates that when the button “Click here” is pressed, the word “Bigger Font” changes to size 35px. Try it out!</p>
       
       <div class="quote">
         <code class="code5">
            <span class="span6"> < </span> 
            <span class="span7"> button type=</span>
            <span class="span8"> "button"</span> 
            <span class="span9"> onclick=</span>
            <span class="span10"> "document.getElementById('demo').style.fontSize='35px'"</span>
            <span class="span11"> > </span>
            <span class="span12"> Click </span> 
            <span class="span13"> here < </span> 
            <span class="span14">/button> </span>
         </code>
       </div>
       <div id="btn-click">
     <button class="btn-click">Click here</button>
   </div>

    <p class="bigger">Bigger Font</p>

    <h3 class="h3-6">The Technology Stack</h3>

    <p> Alright, so now we understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Next, we need to tackle frameworks and libraries, which are part of the <strong> technology stack</strong>. A tech stack is the combination of software, applications, programming languages, and tools that all build on top of each other to make your website. Companies and web developers will use different tech stacks based on their unique needs and goals.</p>

    <p> So, what are frameworks and libraries, and why do we need them? While you can technically make a webpage without these tools, you won’t make it very far as a web developer without them.</p>

    <img class="image4" src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/6329443406577664/image/download/5151212413386752" alt="image4">
    
    <h3 class="h3-7"> What are frameworks?</h3>
<p>You could build a webpage completely from scratch, but it takes a lot of time, especially when you want to add more complexity. That’s where JavaScript frameworks come in handy. A framework is like a prepackaged structure of pre-written code for your website that determines how programs should interact.</p>

<p>Say you wanted to build a car. Instead of starting entirely from scratch, you can buy a vehicle frame to save time and guarantee you’ll build something that will actually drive. A framework in web development is similar. It offers built-in programs, plug-ins, and tools that you install into your website files. Frameworks speed up your development process, and they are made by other developers, so you know the code is pre-tested and effective.</p>

<p>There are backend and frontend frameworks that use different programming languages. Let’s look at a few notable ones to get you started.</p>

   <div class="twoblockquotes">
      <div class="div-blockquote1">
         <blockquote class="bq1">
            <p> <strong>Backend Frameworks</strong></p>
            <ul>
               <li> <strong> Express JS:</strong> used by IBM and Uber; minimalist design; harder for beginners</li>
               <li> <strong>Django:</strong> used by Google, Instagram; tons of built-in features; based on Python</li>
               <li><strong>Spring Boot:</strong> easy to use; good for large scale cloud projects; based on Java</li>
               <li> <strong>Ruby on Rails:</strong> used by SoundCloud; good for small projects; based on Ruby</li>
               <li> <strong>Flask:</strong> used by Lyft; easy to set up; based on Python</li>
            </ul>
         </blockquote>
      </div>

      <div class="div-blockquote2">
         <blockquote class="bq2">
            <p><strong> Frontend Frameworks</strong></p>
            <ul>
               <li> <strong> Ember: </strong> used by Netflix, LinkedIn; good for mobile apps; based in JavaScript</li>
               <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/what-is-react-tutorial" target="_blank">  <strong> React</a>: </strong> easy DOM manipulation; easy to learn; based in JavaScript</li>
               <li> <strong> Backbone: </strong> lightweight; helps with code organization; based in JavaScript</li>
               <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/vue-js-component-jest" target="_blank">  <strong> Vue</a>: </strong> progressive frameworks; easy to understand; based in JavaScript</li>
               <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/angularjs-tutorial" target="_blank">  <strong> Angular</a>: </strong> good for Single-Page applications; not SEO friendly; based in TypeScript</li>
            </ul>
         </blockquote>
      </div>

    <h4 class="h4-2">What are libraries?</h4>
    
<p> A library is a collection of specific tools and features that you can add to your website for functionality. Unlike a framework, a library does not offer any structure but rather implements different behaviors and actions on your webpage.</p>

<p> Let’s return to our car analogy. If the framework is the frame of the car, the libraries are the features and parts you add to the car to tailor it to your needs, like the tires, air conditioner, or steering wheel.</p>

<p> There are tons of different libraries that each have diverse purposes.</p>

<p> Let’s take a look at a few to get a sense of what they can do.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote3">
   <ul>
      <li>jQuery: for manipulating HTML, DOM, and CSS</li>
      <li>React.js: for creating interactive UIs</li>
      <li>Chart.js: for making charts using JavaScript</li>
      <li>Wow.js: for showing animations as you scroll</li>
      <li>Scrolline.js: for showing how far you’ve scrolled on a page</li>
   </ul>
</blockquote>

<p> jQuery and React.js are the most important libraries for you to learn at this time. They are very popular and have hundreds of unique features to make some really cool stuff.</p>


<h3 class="h3-8">What is Node.js?</h3>
<p> Node.js is a popular open-source, server-side tool for fullstack and back-end developers.</p>

<p> Node is a run-time environment used for executing your web programs. It’s very useful for building network applications. It also comes packed with a library of JavaScript modules to simplify your web application process.</p>

<p>Node.js is becoming more standardized even at enterprise-level organizations, so it’s a valuable tool to master.</p>

<div class="div">
   <h2 class="div-h2">Keep the learning going.</h2>
   <p>Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without scrubbing through videos or scattered articles. Educative’s text-based courses are easy to skim and feature live coding environments - making learning quick and efficient. </p>

</div>

<h2 class="h2-heading">What other tools do I need to become a web developer?</h2>   

  <p>Having the right tools before you get started will prepare you to learn faster and more efficiently. Fortunately, you can get started with just three basic things: a browser, a text editor, and a version control system.</p>

  </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Web Browsers</h3>
<p> This is where you will test your code. A good web developer should be comfortable using many different kinds of browsers, but as you’re getting started, it’s fine to stick with one until you feel more comfortable.</p>

<p> The most common browsers used by web developers are outlined below.</p>

<p> This list is not exhaustive, so you will see several others as you research and learn.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote4">
 <ul>
   <li><strong> Mozilla Firefox:</strong> open-source, native on all platforms, lots of updates</li>
   <li><strong> Google Chrome:</strong> DevTools, easy to troubleshoot JavaScript, uses a lot of memory</li>
   <li><strong> Edge:</strong> integrated with Windows, cons similar to IE</li>
   <li><strong> Brave:</strong> focused on performance, secure, poor plug-in support</li>
   <li><strong> Safari:</strong> great dev tools, not integrated with Windows</li>
   <li><strong> Opera:</strong> free VPS service, cons similar to IE</li>
 </ul>
</blockquote> 

 <h3>Text Editors</h3>
<p> This is where you will write your code. There are many different options for text editors. You computer likely comes with a built-in one, but we recommend a more robust option.</p>

<p> The most commonly used text editors by web developers are:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote5">
   <ul>
      <li><strong> Atom:</strong> open-source, cross-platform, created by GitHub, known for its speed (free)</li>
      <li><strong> Sublime Text:</strong> cross-platform, known for its plugins and shortcuts ($70)</li>
      <li><strong>  VS Code:</strong> open-source, created by Microsoft, interactive debugger (free)</li>
      <li><strong> Brackets:</strong> open-source, made by Adobe, live preview feature (free)</li>

 <p>Unlike browsers, most web developers stick with the same text editor. Explore your different options to see which one is most comfortable for you. The more you use it, the more muscle memory you will build.</p>

  <h3>Content Management System (CMS)</h3>
<p> A Content Management System is a software used to facilitate editing, creating, and publishing your work.</p>

<p> A CMS gives you control over your content by integrating all of the features of your site into an accessible platform. Many of these help with both content management, marketing, and content delivery.</p>

<p> A CMS typically uses a <strong> database</strong> (such as <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/mysql-tutorial" target="_blank"> MySQL</a> and MariaDB), which stores a collection of programs and tools in a particular programming language. That way, you can edit and manage your website without needing to return to the minute details of your code.</p>

<p> Choosing a CMS depends on a lot of different factors, like your users, the size of your team, and the ease of the interface. A good CMS for beginners is WordPress.</p>

<p> It’s a free, open source hosting service for building and publishing websites. It’s very popular for bloggers and has a low entry barrier for beginners. With a huge community of support, you’re likely to find answers to your questions as they come up.</p>

<p> Some other notable CMS softwares are Drupal, Typo3, and Joomla!</p>

<h3 > What jobs are there for web developers?</h3>
<p> Once you feel confident in your web dev skills, it’s time to actually start looking for work and apply your skills to the real-world. Where do you begin? What are the options for you?</p>

<p> Let’s look at three things you’ll need to consider as you figure out the job that is best for you.</p>


<h3> Step 1: Determine your web dev specialization</h3>
<p> The first step to looking for work is to determine what kind of web developer you want to be. There are three different categories of web developer jobs to consider: <strong> frontend, backend, and full stack.</strong></p>

<p> You might not know yet which is a better fit for you, and that’s fine! The more you practice and explore, the clearer that will become.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote6"> <strong> Frontend Web Developers</strong> work on the layout and visuals of a website and use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They work with web design and user experience. This kind of web dev is good for someone who likes fine-tuning details. The salary for a front-end web developer generally ranges from US$45k - $75k.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote7"> <strong> Backend Web Developers</strong> work on the frameworks of a website that fetch and display data. They use languages like Java, Python, and Ruby on top of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This kind of web dev is good for someone who cares more about functionality than design. The salary for a back-end web developer generally ranges from US$55k - 85k.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote8"> <strong> Full Stack Web Developers </strong>deal with both sides of web development. The salary for a full stack developer generally ranges from US$60k - 110k.

<h3> Step 2: Determine what work environment is best for you</h3>
<p> Before jumping into a career, you should consider the different work environments available to a web developer. You could work freelance, find a full-time job with a big company, join a start-up, or even go into teaching. Think about which environment is best for your life situation. This will determine how you market yourself, how you design your portfolio, and where you look for job postings.</p>


<h3> Step 3: Start building a portfolio of your awesome projects and skills</h3>
<p> A killer web developer portfolio is critical for getting jobs in the field. This is the website where you showcase all your hard-earned skills, beautiful designs, and best web projects. We know you’re just starting out, so don’t let this step overwhelm you.</p>

<p> As you learn more and practice, you’ll start to compile pretty much everything you need for a portfolio. Your portfolio can even showcase your early work and your practice projects!</p>

<p> There are a lot of hosting websites where you can publish your portfolios. Here are three great options for those of you starting out.</p>

<p> Go check out them out and get some inspiration from other web developers: Github Pages, Repl, Carbonmade, Krop.</p>

 <h3>Where do I find job postings?</h3>
<p> Now that you know what kinds of jobs are out there, you need to know where to find them. There are a lot of resources for job searching that range from general to specialized.</p>

<p> Important note: One of the best ways to learn about job openings is through the Web Dev community. Networking is a key way to learn about jobs and see what kind of work excites you. Don’t be afraid to go to meetups, conferences, and job workshops.</p>
