    <p><strong>Hundreds of thousands of people have been left without power, <br> after Storm Fiona hit Canada's coastline.</strong></p>
   <p> Fiona was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm on Friday.</p>

<p>But parts of three provinces experienced torrential rain and winds of up to <br> 160km/h (99mph), with trees and powerlines felled and houses washed into the sea.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the situation was critical, and promised to <br> provide support through the army.</p>

<p>Officials have yet to share reports of fatalities or serious injuries, but <br> authorities are dealing with extensive flooding.</p>

<p>In a briefing Mr Trudeau described Fiona as "a very powerful and dangerous storm" <br> and said the army will be deployed to help with assessment and clean-up efforts. <br> His government has already responded positively to a request by Nova Scotia authorities for assistance.</p>

<p>"If there is anything the federal government can do to help, we will be there,"  <br> he said, adding that he would no longer travel to Japan to attend the funeral of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>

<p>Tropical storm warnings were issued for the Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia, <br> Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, as well as in parts of Quebec.</p>

<p>The country's eastern region could receive up to 10in (25cm) of rain, increasing <br> the risk of flash flooding.</p>

<div class="p2">
<p>In Nova Scotia, shelters were prepared in Halifax and Cape Breton for <br> people to take cover ahead of the storm.</p>

<p>"We have been through these types of events before, but my fear is, not <br> to this extent," said Amanda McDougall, mayor of Cape Breton Regional Municipality. <br> "The impacts are going to be large, real and immediate."</p>

<p>In Port aux Basques, with a population of 4,067 on the southwest tip of <br> Newfoundland, intense flooding saw some homes and office buildings washed out to sea, <br> local journalist Rene Roy, told CBC. The area is under a state of emergency.</p>

<p>"This is hands down the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my life,<br> " Mr Roy said.</p>

<p>He added that many homes were left as "a pile of rubble in the ocean right now", <br> adding: "There is an apartment building that's literally gone. There are entire streets that are gone."</p>

<p>Officials later confirmed that at least 20 homes had been lost.</p>

<p>And the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said a woman was rescued after being "tossed <br> into the water as her home collapsed" in the area. They said another report of a <br> women being swept out from her basement had been received, but conditions remained too <br> dangerous to conduct a search.</p>

<p>Power companies have warned that it could take days to restore electricity, as wind <br> speeds remain too high to start work on downed power lines.</p>

<p>Severe hurricanes in Canada are rare, as storms lose their energy once they hit colder <br> waters in the north and become post-tropical instead. But pressure in the region <br> is predicted to be historically low as Storm Fiona hits, making way for a heavier storm.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia was last battered by a tropical cyclone in 2003 with Hurricane Juan, a category <br> two storm that killed two people and heavily damaged structures and vegetation.</p>

<p>Meteorologist Bob Robichaud warned on Friday afternoon that Fiona will be bigger than Juan, <br> and stronger than 2019's Hurricane Dorian, which also reached the shores of Nova Scotia.</p>

<div class="p3">
<p>Fiona had already wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic <br> earlier this week, with many still left without power or running water.</p>

<p>Florida also faces a hurricane threat as tropical storm Ian strengthened as it <br> moved over the Caribbean on Saturday. It could approach Florida early next <br> week as a major hurricane.</p>

<p>Ian's projected path takes it just south of Jamaica, over western Cuba and into <br> Florida, the hurricane centre said.</p>

<p>Florida Keys and South Florida could be hit by heavy rains on Monday, <br> according to <a class="atag" href="nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/241147.shtml"> forecasters</a>.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency on Friday, <br> freeing up funding and <br> emergency services in advance of the storm.</p>
